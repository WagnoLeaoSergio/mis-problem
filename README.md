# Maximum Independent Set problem

## Description

In this proje we developed the main components and functions needed to implement heuristic algorithms to solve the maximum independent problem (MIS) and graph theory algorithms.

## MIS Problem

The Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem in graph theory is the task of finding the largest independent set in a graph, where an independent set is a set of vertices such that no two vertices are adjacent. There is currently no known efficient algorithm to find maximum independent sets.

## Algorithms

Implemented algorithms:

- Dijkstra's algorithm;
- Floyd algorithm;
- Prim's algorithm;
- Kruskal's algorithm;
- Greedy;
- Greedy Randomized;
- Greedy Randomized Adaptive.
- Other graph theory functions.

## How to run

To run the code, simply run:

```
g++ *.cpp -o main
main [INPUT PATH] [OUTPUT PATH] [BOOL FOR GRAPH WEIGHTS] [BOOL FOR DIRECTED GRAPH]
```
